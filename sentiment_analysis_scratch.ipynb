My mom and I decided to eat dinner here after our mini-shopping spree for Christmas. The ambiance has changed significantly but it brings me back to my childhood of eating Denny's at this particular location. I'm glad they're able to survive and thrive during the pandemic. It wasn't a busy and were seated immediately. We were able to choose our spot and sat closer to the kitchen and hallway to the restroom. I ordered the Plate Lickin' Fried Chicken with sides of red skin potatoes and steamed vegetables. My mom ordered the country fried steak with mashed potatoes and a side salad. Since we were in the mood for dinner but still wanted a small taste of breakfast, we ordered a side stack of pancakes. (If you don't want a full breakfast plate, just make sure to read carefully and look for the sides on the lower page of the menu). They also have Coke Zero in case you still want soda but calorie free, with refills. Props to Ryan for his above and beyond skills at accommodating us. Our orders arrived within 10 minutes. The Plate Lickin Fried Chicken had two breaded fried chicken breasts and blended well with their cream sauce and sides. The chicken was still crispy and tender. Surprisingly their food is not as greasy as I remembered and still had room for pancakes. Their pancakes are hella fluffy, moist and matches with their pancake syrup. Please note that upon finishing your meal, be sure to pay your tab at the cashier towards the entrance. I love their cute Christmas tree.\",\n","    \"This restaurant has good food\",\n","    \"try burger of dooney's, its quite good\"\n","    ]\n","\n","for new_review in new_reviews:\n","  new_review = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([new_review])\n","  new_review = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(new_review, maxlen=200)\n","  prediction = model.predict(new_review)\n","  prediction_label = encoder.inverse_transform(prediction.round().astype(int))\n","  print(\"Sentiment:\", prediction_label[0])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"MpDHMYGM_0ha","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675875509239,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":1198,"user":{"displayName":"Hammad Mukhtar","userId":"00815075610196720005"}},"outputId":"acfe7ad9-466a-4701-844a-8e6ab78d178d"},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1/1 [==============================] - 1s 751ms/step\n","Sentiment: negative\n","1/1 [==============================] - 0s 37ms/step\n","Sentiment: positive\n","1/1 [==============================] - 0s 35ms/step\n","Sentiment: positive\n"]}]}]}
